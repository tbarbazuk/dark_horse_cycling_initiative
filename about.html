    <h2>About Dark Horse Cycling Initiative</h2>

    <p>
      Founded in 2024 and oficially launched in 2025, Dark Horse Cycling Initiative (DHCI) is a non-profit, community-driven racing team and cycling club dedicated to promoting grassroots and UCI-level racing. As an international chapter, we bring together cyclists from diverse backgrounds across the globe, fostering a truly global community.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our mission is to create an inclusive environment where cyclists of all ages, genders, and backgrounds can come together to grow their passion for the sport. We strongly support grassroots racing and are committed to making cycling a lower-cost, accessible sport for young racers.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe that cycling is for everyone, whether you're just starting out or competing at the highest levels. Through training, mentorship, and community events, DHCI supports riders on every step of their journey â€” empowering local talent and encouraging diversity across the cycling community.
    </p>

    <p>
      Join us as we ride together, push our personal limits, and build a stronger, more vibrant competitive cycling culture.
